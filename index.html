  <h1>Sebastian's WishList</h1>
<p>Christmas is just around the corner, what better way to celebrate the holidays

Here is my list of what I would like for Christmas this holiday season!<br>

      <td>ðŸŽµ</td>
      <td>I would love to have my very own vinyl record player. I want this year to get more into purchasing physical media of 
      albums and songs instead of just relying on my phone to hear music.</td>
    </tr>
  </tr>
